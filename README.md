# RISP: Realtime Integer Streaming Protocol

## Overview

RISP is an application implementing an demo protocol for streaming a sequence of integers from a server to a client.

### Features

RISP supports the following features:

- The server can handle multiple clients concurrently.
- A checksum sent by the server is used to verify the sequence received by the client is correct.
- A dynamic window size is used to adapt to connection stability.
- An acknowledgement strategy is implemented to ensure that dropped messages are resent by the server.
- The connection is stateful and the server uses a session store to persist client state. Clients can thus freely disconnect and reconnect (within 30s) to resume receiving the sequence.

### Protocol

The RISP protocol is _loosely_ modelled on TCP.

#### Message Structure

A message can be in one of four states:

1. `CONNECTING` - this state is used for the setup handshake. It is only sent by a client and indicates that it is trying to (re)connect to the server.
2. `CONNECTED` - this indicates that the connection is healthy and data transfer is occuring.
3. `CLOSING` - this state is used for the closing handshake. The client sends a `CLOSING` message to request for the checksum, which the server returns on a `CLOSING` message.
4. `CLOSED` - this state is used for the closing handshake. The client sends a `CLOSED` message to indicate that the sequence has been received, to which the server responds with a `CLOSED` message.

A client message includes the following fields:

- `state` is one of the aforementioned message states.
- `len` is the length of the sequence requested
- `uuid` is the client's UUID
- `window` is the current window size
- `ack` is the position of the last successfully received message

A server message includes the following fields:

- `state` is one of the aforementioned message states.
- `index` is the index of the payload in the sequence
- `payload` is the value in the sequence at the given index
- `checksum` is the sum of all values in the sequence

#### Choreography

The usual correspondence is as follows:

1. The client sends a `CONNECTING` message to the server with its UUID, a sequence length and an initial window size.
2. The server sends back up to _window_ `CONNECTED` messages to the client with the sequence values on the payload.
3. The client when all messages in the window are received, or a timeout occurs, the client sends a `CONNECTED` message to the server with the `ack` field set to the index of the last known sequence element. If messages were received without issue, the client can increase the window size.
4. Steps 2 and 3 repeat until the client receives the entire sequence, at which point it sends a `CLOSING` message with the `ack` value set to the sequence length.
5. The server responds with a `CLOSING` message containing the checksum of the sequence.
6. The client sends a `CLOSED` message on receipt of the checksum, and the server replied with a `CLOSED` message before terminating the connection.

A client can disconnect at any point in the flow. If it reconnects with a `CONNECTING` message and the same UUID, the server will restore the session state.

If messages sent by the server are lost, the client can request them again by sending a `CONNECTING` message with the `ack` flag set to the first missing index in the sequence. The server will then resend sequence values from that point forwards.

### Project Structure

This project is organised in accordance with the best practices described [here](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

The folder structure is as follows:

- `/bin` holds any built executable binaries.
- `/cmd/<name>` holds the top-level entrypoints. Each folder `<name>` should hold a `main.go` to produce a standalone binary for that application.
- `/pkg` holds public packages that can be imported and used by external projects. Strict semantic versioning must be followed here.
- `/scripts` holds utility bash scripts and the like.
- `/configs` holds application config.
- `/api` holds api and service definitions.
- `/internal` holds logic internal to the application which should not be imported by external projects (this is enforced by the Go compiler)
- `/internal/pkg` holds internal package code
- `/internal/app/apps` holds different application entrypoints. For example, a single binary can have multiple execution modes by leveraging different app implementations in here, while keeping dependencies separate.
- `/internal/app/cfg` holds application configuration to connect to external dependencies (databases, services, etc). Each configuration is implemented just once but can be used to configure any app type that needs it.

## Getting Started

### Application Setup

To build the application binary (you need Go 1.17):

```
make build
```

This puts the application binary in `./bin/risp`. For ease of use, you can create an alias for your current session:

```
alias risp="./bin/risp"
```

Now all you need to do is set up your environment for the current shell session:

```
export $(cat ./configs/dev.env | xargs)
```

And now you're ready to start running `risp` commands!

```

### Running Tests

**To run unit tests:**

```
make test_unit
```

**To run integration tests:**

```
make test_integ
```


### Run a Demo

Start the server:

```
risp server
```

In another terminal, start the client (you can run many of these at once):

```
risp client 50
```

You can also watch the demo video in the project root.

## Additional Notes

### Further Improvements

- Dockerise server application. I didn't have time for this, but I hope you don't have too much trouble getting up and running.
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing. I didn't have time for this, but I included some small example tests to demonstrate my awareness of the topic.
- Secure the gRPC connection with TLS.
- Use a _selective acknowledgement_ strategy to further minimise re-sending messages that the client has successfully received. (Currently, everything is resent from the first undelivered item in the sequence onwards).
- Add a session cleanup strategy for the server, to clean up the session state after 30s. I didn't have time to implement this.
